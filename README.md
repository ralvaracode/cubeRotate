# Description

Implementation of a cube that rotates.

## Trouble Shooting

It didnt render folling the method suggested in tutorial. I needed to make a local download of three.js to run the scene

## Reference Video

[Three.js Cube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAJNYQLexIQ&list=PLT5klp7W4r8TprwP0xZvVC64WSfRUQFY-)

add this to the top of the js files to have documentation of three js functions on hover over

```javascript
// @ts-check
/** @type {import('three')} */
import * as THREE from 'three';
```

you have also the alternative of using typescript
